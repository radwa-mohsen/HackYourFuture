            <p>
              🍾 And today was a momentous occasion … <b>Claudia (@kind_van_de_natuur)</b> was
              christening her brand-new, custom-made 5mm Elios (@eliossub) wetsuit 🤩😍😎 🛟 We
              headed out on a single buoy to our regular 25-metre spot in the middle of the lake in
              sight of<b> the Watersportcentrum (@sloterplas)</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
              🌡️ Water temp. was still about<b> 5/6°C</b> but air temp. was quite mild: 10/11°C.
              Despite this mild air temperature, all three of us thought it felt colder and that we
              got colder quicker than on earlier dives in more wintery conditions with air temps. of
              close to <b>0°C</b>. We attributed this to the fact that we were three on a buoy
              instead of four on two buoys. In other words, we were spending more time at the
              surface between our dives.
            </p>
            <p>
              📉 All three of us mixed it up with hangs, <b>#FIM</b> and <b>#CWTB</b> dives into the
              lower depths of the lake. ⏱️ Jamie’s recent focus has been on dive duration, precise
              dive time estimation and descent/ascent speed in combination with visualisations. His
              muse and mantra being <b>Alenka Artnik’s (@alenka_artnik’s)</b> bifinning style and
              technique. And it’s paying off … effortless and fluid <b>#CWTB</b> to 25m and back in
              exactly 50secs.
            </p>
            Technique NOT speed being the focus. <br />
            <p>
              ⌛️ Around 50-55 minutes later we headed back to the jetty to be greeted by a howling
              Dodger and a chill, relaxed <b>Hakim (@hakim_elkholy)</b>! 🤷🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏻‍♂️ Why? Why else! To
              join Claudia and Jamie, who stripped off their wetsuits to take a plunge with Hakim
              into the lake in their swimming trunks/costumes 👙🩳🩲🩱 🎉🥳🎈 And as usual the
              gezelligheid continued with coffee, teas, fries, soup, sandwiches in the Boothuis
              until we all had to head off to carry out our weekends’ big plans!
