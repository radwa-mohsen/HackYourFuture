            🍾 And today was a momentous occasion … Claudia (@kind_van_de_natuur) was christening
            her brand-new, custom-made 5mm Elios (@eliossub) wetsuit 🤩😍😎 🛟 We headed out on a
            single buoy to our regular 25-metre spot in the middle of the lake in sight of the
            Watersportcentrum (@sloterplas). <br />
            🌡️ Water temp. was still about 5/6°C but air temp. was quite mild: 10/11°C. Despite this
            mild air temperature, all three of us thought it felt colder and that we got colder
            quicker than on earlier dives in more wintery conditions with air temps. of close to
            0°C. We attributed this to the fact that we were three on a buoy instead of four on two
            buoys. In other words, we were spending more time at the surface between our dives.<br />
            📉 All three of us mixed it up with hangs, #FIM and #CWTB dives into the lower depths of
            the lake. ⏱️ Jamie’s recent focus has been on dive duration, precise dive time
            estimation and descent/ascent speed in combination with visualisations. His muse and
            mantra being Alenka Artnik’s (@alenka_artnik’s) bifinning style and technique. And it’s
            paying off … effortless and fluid #CWTB to 25m and back in exactly 50secs.<br />
            Technique NOT speed being the focus. <br />
            ⌛️ Around 50-55 minutes later we headed back to the jetty to be greeted by a howling
            Dodger and a chill, relaxed Hakim (@hakim_elkholy)! 🤷🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏻‍♂️ Why? Why else! To join
            Claudia and Jamie, who stripped off their wetsuits to take a plunge with Hakim into the
            lake in their swimming trunks/costumes 👙🩳🩲🩱 🎉🥳🎈 And as usual the gezelligheid
            continued with coffee, teas, fries, soup, sandwiches in the Boothuis until we all had to
            head off to carry out our weekends’ big plans!

            her brand-new, custom-made 5mm Elios (@eliossub) wetsuit 🤩😍😎 🛟 We headed out on a
            single buoy to our regular 25-metre spot in the middle of the lake in sight of the
            Watersportcentrum (@sloterplas). <br />
            🌡️ Water temp. was still about 5/6°C but air temp. was quite mild: 10/11°C. Despite this
            mild air temperature, all three of us thought it felt colder and that we got colder
            quicker than on earlier dives in more wintery conditions with air temps. of close to
            0°C. We attributed this to the fact that we were three on a buoy instead of four on two
            buoys. In other words, we were spending more time at the surface between our dives.<br />
            📉 All three of us mixed it up with hangs, #FIM and #CWTB dives into the lower depths of
            the lake. ⏱️ Jamie’s recent focus has been on dive duration, precise dive time
            estimation and descent/ascent speed in combination with visualisations. His muse and
            mantra being Alenka Artnik’s (@alenka_artnik’s) bifinning style and technique. And it’s
            paying off … effortless and fluid #CWTB to 25m and back in exactly 50secs.<br />
            Technique NOT speed being the focus. <br />
